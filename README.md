# SpringMVCFilmSite

# Description
For this assignment we took our code we had written in the prior week, which conducted an SQL query to a database for films and all its associated data, and connected it to a server to display on a web-page using SpringMVC, servlets, JSPs, and xml files. 

# Technologies Used
Eclipse IDE, Tomcat, MySQL, Maven, Java, JSP, SpringMVC


# Lessons Learned
In this lesson we learned primarily how to integrate SpringMVC into our code to allow for the smooth transition of HTML data transfer to a server. The more difficult part of this was debugging and looking for the smallest of errors as I quickly learned, this code is unforgiving. By making sure the servlets, xml, and jsp files were all spelled correctly and in the right locations, the code will be able to run on the servers and show the results on a web-page.
